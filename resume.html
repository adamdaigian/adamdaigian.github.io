           <p>10+ years as a business leader with a proven track record in developing businesses and driving significant customer growth.

            <p>Time is a prescious commodity which is why I allocate mine across a key set of investments. Learn more about how I work by reading my <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ldSGKlTXWDFvoGPux6W87uS_A2GitK44Ih-NWjMqkV8/edit?usp=sharing">user guide</a>.</p>

                  <h5 class="legend-title">Strategy</h5>
                  <p>I focus strategic vision for one quarter to one year out, especially as it relates to creating and hitting goals. By taking on the responsibility of collecting and aggregating data I work to inform the executive strategy and vision beyond that timeframe. Strategy is a key ingredient in alignment and an important lever for management in all directions.</p>

                  <h5 class="legend-title">Coaching & Mentorship</h5>
                  <p>Solid coaching and mentorship allow a leader to become a force multiplier and one of the most valuable things I can do is continually enable the team to execute and level up.</p>

                  <h5 class="legend-title">Research & Analysis</h5>
                  <p>Data and Research are core to my leadership strategy. The more business questions answered, the more insights collected, the more confident we can be in our strategy and the better our decisions when we have to rely on intuition.</p>

                  <h5 class="legend-title">Execution</h5>

            <h5>Growing Hustle</h5>
            <p>At Hustle, we raised 30M in funding from top investors and then I successfully built and scaled multiple revenue functions ultimately leading a significant portion of the go-to-market organization.</p>
            <h5>Surfing Around The World</h5>
            <p>Since becoming an adult, I've sought to surf the largest waves in the Bay Area (Mavericks and Ocean Beach). Balancing my passion for surfing with ambitious career goals hasn't always been easy. But surfing has instilled dedication and patience that has helped me persist in career growth. Surfing has also taken me around the world and I regularly travel through Mexico and Indonesia.</p>
