           <p>10+ years as an experienced business leader with a proven track record in setting up businesses and driving customers. Bringing a unique combination of marketing and sales experience, technology, data and design I’m able to build businesses from scratch or scale components swiftly. I provide the leadership, mentorship and motivation that ensures teams deliver consistently and beyond expectations.</p>

            <p>Time is a prescious commodity in Startups which is why I allocate mine across a key set of investments.

                  <h5 class="legend-title">Strategy</h5>
                  <p>Primarily I'm focused on today to one year out. I see it as my job to collect data that informs strategy and vision beyond that timeframe. Strategy is all a key ingredient for alignment and a primary lever for managing down and across.</p>
                  <div class="legend marketing"></div>
                  <h5 class="legend-title">Coaching & Mentorship</h5>
                  <p>I take coaching and mentorship very seriously in an effort to become a force multipier. One of the most value things I can do as a leader is constantly level up my team and colleagues across the organization.</p>
                  <div class="legend engineering"></div>
                  <h5 class="legend-title">Execution</h5>
                  <p>My love for building hands on skills means that I still roll up my sleaves with the team and focus on hands on execution. Whether it's copywriting, engineering, maketing operations or writing SQL, I still like to get my hands dirty.</p>
                  <div class="legend analysis"></div>
                  <h5 class="legend-title">Research & Analysis</h5>
                  <p>Data and Research are core to my leadership strategy. The more business questions we can answer, the more insights we can drive, the better your strategic direction and the better your decisions when all you have to work with is intuition.</p>
                  <div class="legend mentoring"></div>
                  <h5 class="legend-title">Alignment & Relfection</h5>
                  <p>To be effective in a startup, you have to have solid relationships. I dedicate time to getting to know my peers or direct reports and help them develop any way I can.</p>
